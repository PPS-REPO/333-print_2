# Problem

In programming, there's something called input and output. 
Among them, we are going to start with output for the second time. 
This problem is the second programming problem we learn, which is to output "Hello!" across two lines.

# Input

There is no input for this problem.

# Output

Output "Hello!" across two lines.

n Python:

```py
print("Hello!Hello!")
```
In C++ or C:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
  printf("Hello!Hello!");
  return 0;
}
```

can solve this problem.
